 * 
 * Final words Overall, it seems that Java 10 is unlikely to contain any major
 * new features or performance improvements. This is perhaps to be expected -
 * instead of vast change, it represents the first release in the new, more
 * frequent and gradual release cycle.
 * 
 * Java 10 is the fastest release of a java version in its 23 year history.
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>

Java provided supports for functional programming, new JavaScript engine, new APIs for date time manipulation, new streaming API, etc.
