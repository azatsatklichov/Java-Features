Oracle has now switched to a new, time based model – a move that is still being discussed and viewed as controversial.

Oracle has responded to these concerns and continues to offer long-term releases on a regular basis, but also at longer intervals. 
And after Java 8, it is Java 11, which will probably receive a long term support again.

JDK 10
JDK 10 is the open-source reference implementation of the Java SE 10 Platform as defined by JSR 383 in the Java Community Process.

JDK 10 reached General Availability on 20 March 2018. Production-ready binaries under the GPL are available from Oracle; binaries from other vendors will follow shortly.

The features and schedule of this release were proposed and tracked via the JEP Process, as amended by the JEP 2.0 proposal.

Phases
We stabilized the release in an increasingly-rigorous sequence of phases, listed here for the record:

Rampdown Phase One
Rampdown Phase Two
Release-Candidate Phase
During those phases we used three processes to coordinate our work:

Bug-deferral process (RDP 1 and later)
Late-enhancement request request process
Fix-request process (RDP 2 and later)
