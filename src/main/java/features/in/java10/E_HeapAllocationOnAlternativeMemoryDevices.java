 * JEP 316: Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices
 * 
 * <pre>
 *This JEP enables the
 * HotSpot VM to allocate the Java object heap on an alternative memory device,
 * specified by the user. This new feature would, for example, make it possible
 * in a multi-JVM environment to assign lower priority processes to use the
 * NV-DIMM memory, and instead only allocate the higher priority processes to
 * the DRAM.
