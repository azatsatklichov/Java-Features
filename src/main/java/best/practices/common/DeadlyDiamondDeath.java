/**
 * Some languages (like C++) allow a class to extend more than one other class.
 * This capability is known as "multiple inheritance." The reason that Java's
 * creators chose not to allow multiple inheritance is that it can become quite
 * messy. In a nutshell, the problem is that if a class extended two other
 * classes, and both superclasses had, say, a doStuff() method, which version of
 * doStuff() would the subclass inherit? This issue can lead to a scenario known
 * as the "Deadly Diamond of Death," because of the shape of the class diagram
 * that can be created in a multiple inheritance design. The diamond is formed
 * when classes B and C both extend A, and both B and C inherit a method from A.
 * If class D extends both B and C, and both B and C have overridden the method
 * in A, class D has, in theory, inherited two different implementations of the
 * same method. Drawn as a class diagram, the shape of the four classes looks
 * like a diamond.
