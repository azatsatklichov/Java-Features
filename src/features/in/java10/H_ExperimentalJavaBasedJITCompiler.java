 * JEP 317: Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler
 * 
 * <pre>
*
This JEP introduces the Graal compiler research project to the JDK. A new Java-based JIT compiler which is the 
basis of an experimental Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler. Graal was already added back in Java 9, but now it 
is possible to enable it with the following arguments.

-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler
However, keep in mind that it is in an experimental stage and definitely not recommended for production.
