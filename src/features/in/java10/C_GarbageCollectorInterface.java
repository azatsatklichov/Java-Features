 * This JEP increases code isolation of different garbage collectors and
 * introduces a clean interface for garbage collectors.
 * 
 * This has a couple of advantages such as, for example, making it easier to
 * exclude a GC from a JDK build and making it easier to add a new GC without it
 * affecting the code base.
