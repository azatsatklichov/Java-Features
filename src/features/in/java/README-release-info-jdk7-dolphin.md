# Java 7
Codename Dolphin is a major update that was launched on July 7, 2011[138] and was made available for developers on July 28, 2011.[139] The development period was organized into thirteen milestones; on June 6, 2011, the last of the thirteen milestones was finished.[140][141] On average, 8 builds (which generally included enhancements and bug fixes) were released per milestone. The feature list at the OpenJDK 7 project lists many of the changes.

Additions in Java 7 include:[142]

- JVM support for dynamic languages, with the new invokedynamic bytecode under JSR-292,[143] following the prototyping work currently done on the Multi Language Virtual Machine
- Compressed 64-bit pointers[144] (available in Java 6 with -XX:+UseCompressedOops)[145]
- These small language changes (grouped under a project named Coin):[146]
	- Strings in switch[147]
	- Automatic resource management in try-statement[148]
	- Improved type inference for generic instance creation, aka the diamond operator <>[149]
	- Simplified varargs method declaration[150]
	- Binary integer literals[151]
	- Allowing underscores in numeric literals[152]
	- Catching multiple exception types and rethrowing exceptions with improved type checking[153]
- Concurrency utilities under JSR 166[154]
- New file I/O library (defined by JSR 203) adding support for multiple file systems, file metadata and symbolic links. The new packages are java.nio.file, java.nio.file.attribute and java.nio.file.spi[155][156]
- Timsort is used to sort collections and arrays of objects instead of merge sort
- Library-level support for elliptic curve cryptography algorithms
- An XRender pipeline for Java 2D, which improves handling of features specific to modern GPUs
- New platform APIs for the graphics features originally implemented in version 6u10 as unsupported APIs[157]
- Enhanced library-level support for new network protocols, including SCTP and Sockets Direct Protocol
- Upstream updates to XML and Unicode
- Java deployment rule sets[158]

Lambda (Java's implementation of lambda functions), Jigsaw (Java's implementation of modules), and part of Coin were dropped from Java 7, and released as part of Java 8 (except for Jigsaw, which was in Java 9).[159][160]

Java 7 was the default version to download on java.com from April 2012 until Java 8 was released.[161]

Java 7 updates
Oracle issued public updates to the Java 7 family on a quarterly basis[162] until April 2015 when the product reached the end of its public availability.[163] Further updates for JDK 7, which are scheduled to continue until Jul 2022, are only made available to customers with a support contract.[164]
