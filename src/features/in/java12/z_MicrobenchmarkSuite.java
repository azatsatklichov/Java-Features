/**
 * A way, and a suite of microbenchmarks, to easily test the performance of JDK,
 * based on Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) will be added to JDK source code.
 * 
 * Microbenchmark Suite, JEP 230 feature adds a basic suite of microbenchmarks
 * to the JDK source code. This makes it easy for developers to run existing
 * microbenchmarks and create new ones.
 * 
 * One AArch64 Port, Not Two, JEP 344, removes all of the sources related to the
 * arm64 port while retaining the 32-bit ARM port and the 64-bit aarch64 port.
 * This allows contributors to focus their efforts on a single 64-bit ARM
 * implementation
