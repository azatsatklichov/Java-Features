/**
 * 
 * Program: Write a program to create deadlock between two threads.
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Description:
 * 
 * Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. 
 * 
 * Deadlocks can occur in Java when the synchronized keyword causes the executing thread to block while 
 * waiting to get the lock, associated with the specified object. Since the thread might already hold 
 * locks associated with other objects, two threads could each be waiting for the other to release a lock. 
 * 
 * In such case, they will end up waiting forever.
 * </pre>
