     * file as binary or textual data.
     *

     * Writing File via Java IO
     * 
     * If you need to write a file from one end to the other you can use a
     * FileOutputStream or a FileWriter depending on whether you need to write
     * binary data or characters. If you need to skip around a file and write to it
     * in various places, for instance appending to the end of the file, you can use
     * a RandomAccessFile.
