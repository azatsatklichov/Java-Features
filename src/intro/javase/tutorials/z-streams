What is stream pipelining in Java 8?
Most of the stream operations return stream itself so that their result can be pipelined. 
These operations are called intermediate operations and their function is to take input, 
process them, and return output to the target. collect() method is a terminal operation which
 is normally present at the end of the pipelining operation to mark the end of the stream.


What is the difference between Collections and Stream in Java8 ?
Stream operations do the iterations internally over the source elements provided, in contrast to 
Collections where explicit iteration is required.


What is the purpose of forEach method of stream in java 8?
Stream has provided a new method 'forEach' to iterate each element of the stream.

How will you print 10 random numbers using forEach of java 8?


The following code segment shows how to print 10 random numbers using forEach.
Random random = new Random();
random.ints().limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);


What is the purpose of map method of stream in java 8?
The 'map' method is used to map each element to its corresponding result.


How will you print unique squares of numbers in java 8?
The following code segment prints unique squares of numbers using map.
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(3, 2, 2, 3, 7, 3, 5);
//get list of unique squares
List<Integer> squaresList = numbers.stream().map( i -> i*i).distinct().collect(Collectors


What is the purpose of filter method of stream in java 8?
The 'filter' method is used to eliminate elements based on a criteria.
The following code segment prints a count of empty strings using filter.
List<String>strings = Arrays.asList("abc", "", "bc", "efg", "abcd","", "jkl");
//get count of empty string
int count = strings.stream().filter(string −> string.isEmpty()).count();
 
 
 
 
What is the purpose of limit method of stream in java 8?
The 'limit' method is used to reduce the size of the stream. 


How will you print 10 random numbers in java 8?
The following code segment shows how to print 10 random numbers.
Random random = new Random();
random.ints().limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);
 
 



What is the purpose of sorted method of stream in java 8?
The 'sorted' method is used to sort the stream. 


How will you print 10 random numbers in a sorted order in java 8?
The following code segment shows how to print 10 random numbers in a sorted order.
Random random = new Random();
random.ints().limit(10).sorted().forEach(System.out::println);




What is Parallel Processing in Java 8?


parallelStream is the alternative of stream for parallel processing. Take a look at the following code segment that prints a count of empty strings using parallelStream.
List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("abc", "", "bc", "efg", "abcd","", "jkl");
//get count of empty string
int count = strings.parallelStream().filter(string −> string.isEmpty()).count();
//It is very easy to switch between sequential and parallel streams.


What are collectors in Java 8?


Collectors are used to combine the result of processing on the elements of a stream. Collectors can be used to return a list or a string.
List<String>strings = Arrays.asList("abc", "", "bc", "efg", "abcd","", "jkl");
List<String> filtered = strings.stream().filter(string -> !string.isEmpty()).collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println("Filtered List: " + filtered);
String mergedString = strings.stream().filter(string -> !string.isEmpty()).collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
System.out.println("Merged String: " + mergedString);
