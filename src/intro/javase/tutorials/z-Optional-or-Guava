What is Optional in Java8?


Optional is a container object which is used to contain not-null objects. 
Optional object is used to represent null with absent value. This class has 
various utility methods to facilitate code to handle values as 'available' or 
'not available' instead of checking null values. It is introduced in Java 8 and 
is similar to what Optional is in Guava.
