		 * <pre>
		 * With Java 8, Nashorn, a much improved javascript engine is

		 * times better performance, as it directly compiles the code in memory
		 * and passes the bytecode to JVM. Nashorn uses invoke dynamics feature,
		 * introduced in Java 7 to improve performance.
		 * 
		 *Nashorn fully supports ECMAScript 5.1 specification along with some extensions, to 100% pure Java implementation and 100% 
		 *complied to bytecode and not the interpreted mode as with Rhino. 
		 *
		 *Unlike Rhino, which has its own JavaScript debugger, The Nashorn does not provide it’s own JavaScript debugger but 
		 *it provides an ability to remotely debug applications using an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
